- AWS SDK
- AWS S3
- AWS CloudFront
- AWS Lambda
- AWS API Gateway
- AWS CloudWatch

# Using AWS SAM CLI for testing lambda functions locally

```bash
go build -o yuta ./src/* && sam local start-api
```

or

```bash
scripts/run-sam.sh
```

> Curiosity: Yuta from JJK was chosen as the name of the repo because it storage a lot of cursed energy, it's a reference to the storage on S3
